				<p>I first met Tim at Wayne Valley High School where we quickly bonded over mutual hobbies and class electives.</p>
				<p>Senior year was especially unforgettable for me; from racing around town in search of limited time only junk food, to beating the clock for a lunchtime Wendy's run, Tim and I were together the whole way. For our senior prom we didn't go down to the shore like everyone else, we got everyone we could fit into a van and headed off for the best opening weekend of Six Flags I've ever been too. There was terrible food, no lines, and ride attendants that let us stay on over and over until we all felt sick. The next day we were off to Mountain Creek waterpark where we rode every ride we saw, watched our friend do a cliff dive that may or may not have been an attraction, and became responsible for the new rule where you have to wear helmets on the white water rapids.</p>
				<p>Over the years there were countless adventures and stories, hiking trips, backyard bonfires, hot tubbing, and we even kidnapped our friends game console once. </p>
				<p>College was another special time. With newfound independence we spent many a weekend of our college freshman year wandering around New York City, and even though we attended different schools our friendship only became stronger. For the two of us college was a time for learning, new experiences, and way too much Minecraft. We shared a lot of experiences during that time, parties, nights with new and old friends, stress over homework, and I even took Tim to see The Lion King for the first time in theaters (he likes to point out that he had to pay for parking). </p>
				<p>Post college many things have changed but not our friendship. I’ve watched Tim attempt to build his Jeep for the last four years, he'll get that body on there THIS summer for sure! We've posed for more ridiculous photos than I have space for on my hard drive that I refuse to upgrade. We've been on road trips up and down the east coast, where we survived the dreaded civil engineering and perpetual road maintenance of our nation's capital. </p>
				<p>His families’ new condo in Seaside Heights was a whole new adventure for the two of us, so many weekends with great weather, great company, and the ability to recall almost all of those nights (something something Classic Tim, something something this many fish). There were good times and bad times, days where Tim needed my advice and I needed his. </p>
				<p>I'm proud to hear Tim call me his best man, and I'm even more proud to call Tim my best friend.</p>

				<p>I first met Tim when I was born.  He was not excited to have a little brother because he thought I was going to be born the same size as him (idiot). But then again, there was a time in my childhood where I couldn’t wait until the day that I’d be older than Tim (also idiot).  I wished this because Tim would steal my toys and push me down. In fact, I didn’t take my first steps until pretty late because I wasn’t allowed to stand up, karma made me taller than him though.  Tim has always been someone I looked up to. I remember watching him play Zelda or Donkey Kong for hours on the N64 while I watched from my top bunk eating goldfish, one of the few snacks I knew he couldn’t steal from me (because cheese).  Whether it was Legos, or Rokenbok, or Max Steele, or countless video games, I was always following Tim’s lead.  As we grew into our angsty teenage years, we fought over just about anything we could find a reason to fight over. We ruined countless video game checkpoints by unplugging each-others Xbox’s (yes, separate Xbox’s because we cannot share).  Honestly other than video games, I can’t even remember what we fought about, because it was probably something silly.  Thats just the type of brothers we are, while we are quite different in terms of interests and hobbies, we are the same in our unwillingness to lose or quit, even in situations with the most minor of consequences, and I love Tim for that, because he taught me that.  Thats what makes our brotherhood special, and that’s why I know Tim is going to be a great husband, father and everything in between. He is prepared for anything (literally, look in the trunk of his car) and he will never give up.</p>

				<p>I met Tim in middle school. Growing up we did silly things like strap bottle rockets to Hot Wheels cars with Marc.</p>
				<p>I enjoy doing projects with Tim, even if its a crazy Jeep one. Marc, Tim and I have done a lot of nerdy stuff in our time as friends, and I regret none of it.</p>

				<p>Tim and I have been friends since elementary school, when I was much too young to know better. Being able to get to know someone for such a long time allows you to see how they grow and evolve (and I’m not just talking about his facial hair; what’s up with that?). At every major interval of his life, I got to see Tim mature and succeed just a bit more. But only one time, in all the years that I have known him, did I see such a sudden and marked change in him. I think I knew about Victoria before Tim even told me about her. Though his life itself looked to me to be the same, I noticed a certain newfound “brightness” and energy about him, as if he was living life anew and for the better. It was really annoying. Spoiler alert, that light turned out to be Victoria. Before the two of them, I honestly thought love was as real as unicorns farting rainbows, and believed in only by those who enjoy fairytales and daydreaming. I am so grateful to Tim and Victoria because they have given me—and others I am sure—hope...hope that love is real, and that we can actually have it for ourselves, provided we’re willing to look for it, and to open ourselves up to it. Thanks guys. </p>

				<p>Tim and I are a unique pair and have been known as teaching assistants, Linux-Lab partners, TaylorFit business associates, NJTransit commuters and presently, neighbors; but most importantly -- best friends. We met at Stevens Institute of Technology during our freshman year and have been friends for almost a decade. Tim has always been there for me, encouraging my poorly crafted schemes and antics. Know that if you ever hear any of them, you will be guaranteed to laugh! We share many memories together from breaking into Burchard at Stevens to watch Good Burger, staying up too late working on assignments, developing fake products for real clients in senior design, to hiking around Palisades Park, New Jersey. Around the same time of meeting Tim, I met Victoria. Victoria's and my friendship grew over taking a ridiculous one-credit research course at Stevens. We were the only two students that regularly attended by the end of the semester. Victoria has always been there for me providing advice or inviting me to parties. When we’re not busy being underachievers or graduating with a PhD in Materials Science & Engineering, Tim, Victoria, and I visit Pilsener Haus & Biergarten in Hoboken when we have a free moment. I was honored with the privilege of being a groomsman for Tim and Victoria’s wedding. I am excited to be standing with Tim for the wedding and can't wait to celebrate with him in June.</p>

				<br>
				<p>I met Victoria at Stevens the summer after our freshman year when we were randomly placed in the same on-campus housing. Victoria was taking classes and I was conducting research that allowed me to mostly work from home, so we both spent a lot of time in the apartment. But our friendship was, by no means, a gradual development; rather, we became fast friends and cohorts in crime almost immediately through our mutual love of Avril Lavigne, arts and crafts, baking, and, of course, science. </p>
				<p>During our time at Stevens, we began our true research paths in the same polymer chemistry lab (after all, as everyone knows, the only two good parts of organic chemistry are polymers and alcohol), and our friendship has since extended into our professional lives: Victoria and I are currently involved in a collaborative research initiative related to polymer chemistry and tissue engineering - a project that was actually started during our undergraduate careers at Stevens when we both worked in the same research lab. </p>
				<p>In addition to all the shared interests that made us become friends in the first place, now we are each others biggest support systems as we both work to get our PhDs at different universities. So, when Victoria asked me to be her maid of honor, the answer to the question was pretty obvious (I think the exact phrase was "Did you even have to ask?")</p>

				<p>I met Victoria in 2012, when she was assigned to be my college roommate. We bonded over our love for Stevens Institute of Technology and Pierce dining hall. Or maybe it was venting, sarcasm, and our dry sense of humor that brought us together. I remember Victoria and Mary introducing me to FitnessBlender workout videos on YouTube while we were in college and Victoria and I continue to share our favorite workout videos today. The most memorable part of my senior year with Victoria was Hurricane Sandy. Victoria's family graciously let me stay in their home while NJ recovered. It was like an extended sleepover party with lots of jigsaw puzzles, bananagrams, and yummy food. Although I graduated after that school year, we stayed friends as Victoria worked on her PhD in Texas. </p>

				<br>
				<p>I met Victoria in Texas, when we both moved there to pursue PhDs at Texas A&M University in the department of Materials Science & Engineering. We've bonded over our shared love of red wines, crafting, and women empowerment. We spent the last 4+ years living together, working in the same lab, taking the same classes, carpooling, and enjoying life together!</p>
				<p>Together we started and ran the Women in Materials Science organization for several years. Victoria helped me to enter American society and understand how things work around here. She encouraged me to speak, to explore, and to try everything I’ve never tried before, like leading the team of undergraduate students and even frozen yogurt!</p> 
				<p>I had a chance to meet Tim many times over these years and we've both bonded over our love of classic rock. It makes me happy to see Tim and Victoria so happy together and I am excited to be a part of their wedding!</p>

				<br>
				<p>I met Victoria while studying at Texas A&M University during our PhD. I saw her working with the determination and resilience of an Olympic athlete while still being able to sporadically crack a joke; that’s when I decided that I wanted some of her light in my life. We started bonding over playing basketball together, even though neither of us really knew what we were doing. Victoria was kind enough to offer me company, patience and support during some of my most lonely and stressful moments, first as a recent arrival to the US, and then as a burned out and anxious student. We spent many hours in the lab together lamenting over failed experiments and making each other laugh to stay sane. Over the years, we became close friends through having lunch together, hiking, shopping and defying nature one experiment at a time. Our friendship became precious to me thanks to her limitless love and her inspiring resilience. </p>

				<br>
				<p>I met Victoria through the Materials Science & Engineering Department at Texas A&M University, where we both were studying for our Ph. Ds. While bumping into each other in classes and the Women in Materials Science organization, we started to bond over both being in long-distance relationships. Together, we spent many nights commiserating about the struggles and the ups and downs of being in a Ph. D. program. We enjoy taking long hikes together around Texas, where our current mileage record is over 13 miles!</p>
