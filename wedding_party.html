				<p>I first met Tim at Wayne Valley High School where we quickly bonded over mutual hobbies and class electives.</p>
				<p>Senior year was especially unforgettable for me; from racing around town in search of limited time only junk food, to beating the clock for a lunchtime Wendy's run, Tim and I were together the whole way. For our senior prom we didn't go down to the shore like everyone else, we got everyone we could fit into a van and headed off for the best opening weekend of Six Flags I've ever been too. There was terrible food, no lines, and ride attendants that let us stay on over and over until we all felt sick. The next day we were off to Mountain Creek waterpark where we rode every ride we saw, watched our friend do a cliff dive that may or may not have been an attraction, and became responsible for the new rule where you have to wear helmets on the white water rapids.</p>
				<p>Over the years there were countless adventures and stories, hiking trips, backyard bonfires, hot tubbing, and we even kidnapped our friends game console once. </p>
				<p>College was another special time. With newfound independence we spent many a weekend of our college freshman year wandering around New York City, and even though we attended different schools our friendship only became stronger. For the two of us college was a time for learning, new experiences, and way too much Minecraft. We shared a lot of experiences during that time, parties, nights with new and old friends, stress over homework, and I even took Tim to see The Lion King for the first time in theaters (he likes to point out that he had to pay for parking). </p>
				<p>Post college many things have changed but not our friendship. I’ve watched Tim attempt to build his Jeep for the last four years, he'll get that body on there THIS summer for sure! We've posed for more ridiculous photos than I have space for on my hard drive that I refuse to upgrade. We've been on road trips up and down the east coast, where we survived the dreaded civil engineering and perpetual road maintenance of our nation's capital. </p>
				<p>His families’ new condo in Seaside Heights was a whole new adventure for the two of us, so many weekends with great weather, great company, and the ability to recall almost all of those nights (something something Classic Tim, something something this many fish). There were good times and bad times, days where Tim needed my advice and I needed his. </p>
				<p>I'm proud to hear Tim call me his best man, and I'm even more proud to call Tim my best friend.</p>
				<p>-Marc</p>

				<p>I met Victoria at Stevens the summer after our freshman year when we were randomly placed in the same on-campus housing. Victoria was taking classes and I was conducting research that allowed me to mostly work from home, so we both spent a lot of time in the apartment. But our friendship was, by no means, a gradual development; rather, we became fast friends and cohorts in crime almost immediately through our mutual love of Avril Lavigne, arts and crafts, baking, and, of course, science. </p>
				<p>During our time at Stevens, we began our true research paths in the same polymer chemistry lab (after all, as everyone knows, the only two good parts of organic chemistry are polymers and alcohol), and our friendship has since (six years later) extended into our professional lives: Victoria and I are currently involved in a collaborative research initiative related to polymer chemistry and tissue engineering - a project that was actually started during our undergraduate careers at Stevens when we both worked in the same research lab. </p>
				<p>In addition to all the shared interests that made us become friends in the first place, now we are each others biggest support systems as we both work to get our PhDs at different universities. So, when Victoria asked me to be her maid of honor, the answer to the question was pretty obvious (I think the exact phrase was "Did you even have to ask?")</p>
