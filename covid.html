					<h2>Covid Statement</h2>
					<br>
					<p>We hope that all of our friends and family are staying safe through these scary and unpredictable times. The coronavirus has impacted everyone in unexpected ways. As you may or may not know the Outer Banks are currently closed to all visitors and gatherings of more than 100 people have been discouraged in the state of North Carolina.</p>
					<br>
					<p>At this time we do not know for how long these restrictions will be in place or how they will impact our wedding on June 20th. The next statement from the governor of NC is expected next week and from Dare & Currituck counties on the 15th May. North Carolina is currently under a stay at home order until May 22nd.</p>
					<br>
					<p>Victoria and I care about the health and safety of all of our friends and family. We know that many of you have already made arrangements to take time off from work or have booked rental homes. We know many of you are also afraid to travel in these uncertain times, which is understandable. We also know that several realtors are refusing refunds unless it is prohibited to go to the Outer Banks by law. In the event that you decide not to travel please let us know so we can update your RSVP.</p>
					<br>
					<p>We are currently working on several alternative plans for our wedding; we are determined that we will get married on our intended day even if that happens in a very different way than originally intended. </p>
					<br>
					<p>We will update everyone once we have a clearer picture of what things will look like. For now, we have not canceled nor postponed any of our bookings in the Outer Banks. </p>
					<br>
					<p>We wish everyone the best and hope to see you all soon when this is over. </p>
					<br>
					<p>In the event that we do need to cancel, both of our blocked hotels are offering flexible cancellation policies. Please see the individual hotel websites for details. For those staying in houses please contact your realtors. </p>
